You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.

Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.

You don't believe in the Force, do you? I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Ye-ha! The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.

Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- I find your lack of faith disturbing.

You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly…

Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. As you wish. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.

The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!

He is here. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.

In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. I find your lack of faith disturbing. I'm trying not to, kid. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.

Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? You mean it controls your actions?

I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! Partially, but it also obeys your commands. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.

Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now.

Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. What?!

Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? Red Five standing by.

Ye-ha! All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? What?! The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.

Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.

I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. He is here. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.

All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. I find your lack of faith disturbing.

I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?

You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! You don't believe in the Force, do you? I find your lack of faith disturbing.

Red Five standing by. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.

I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. What?!

Ye-ha! But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? You mean it controls your actions? The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. He is here.

You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--

I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.

Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. What?! All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.

I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.

You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.
